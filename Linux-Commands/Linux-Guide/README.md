# A Beginner's Guide to Linux

## Introduction
Linux is a free, open-source operating system loved by developers, students, and tech enthusiasts. Unlike Windows or macOS, Linux gives you full control over your system. This guide will teach you the basics of using Linux and help you get started.

## 1. What is Linux?
- Linux is an operating system kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
- It’s open-source, meaning anyone can use, modify, and share it.
- Popular distributions (distros) include Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux.

## 2. Getting Started with Linux
### Installing Linux
- Download a distro (e.g., Ubuntu from [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/)).
- Create a bootable USB using tools like Rufus or Etcher.
- Boot from the USB and follow the installation steps.

### Opening the Terminal
- The Terminal is your best friend in Linux. Open it with Ctrl + Alt + T.

## 3. Basic Linux Commands
Here are some essential commands to navigate and manage your system:

- Move around:
  - pwd: Show your current directory (e.g., `/home/user`).
  - ls: List files (use dir on some systems, but ls -a shows hidden files).
  - cd folder_name: Change to a directory.
  - cd ..: Go up one level.

- Manage files:
  - touch file.txt: Create an empty file.
  - nano file.txt: Edit a file (save with Ctrl + O, exit with `Ctrl + X`).
  - rm file.txt: Delete a file.
  - mkdir folder_name: Create a folder.

- System info:
  - whoami: Show your username.
  - uname -a: Display system details.
  - df -h: Check disk space.

## 4. Installing Software
- Using Package Managers:
  - Ubuntu/Debian: Use apt:
       sudo apt update
    sudo apt install package_name
      - Fedora: Use dnf:
       sudo dnf install package_name
      - Arch Linux: Use pacman:
       sudo pacman -S package_name
    
- Example: Install a text editor like vim:
 sudo apt update
    sudo apt install package_name

## 5. File Permissions
- Linux uses permissions to control who can read, write, or execute files.
- Check permissions:
  
 # ls -l
 
  (Output like `-rwxr-xr-x` shows permissions.)
- Change permissions:
  
  chmod +x file.sh   # Make a file executable

## 6. Useful Tips
- **Update your system:**
  
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade  # Ubuntu example
 
- **Find help:**
  - `man command_name`: Show the manual for a command (e.g., `man ls`).
- **Search for files:**
  
  find / -name "file.txt"  # Search the whole system
